## Problem Statement
Many people, especially in underserved communities, find it difficult to access information about government services, welfare schemes, and local opportunities. 
Existing platforms are often complex, difficult to understand, or not available in simple language.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build an AI-powered assistant that helps people easily discover public services, government schemes, and community opportunities. 
The system focuses on simple language, easy access, and inclusive design so that users do not feel confused or left out.

## Target Users
- People from underserved or rural communities  
- Users with low digital literacy  
- Citizens facing language barriers  
- Community members looking for local events and opportunities  

## Functional Requirements
- The system should allow users to search for government services and welfare schemes.
- It should explain scheme details and eligibility in simple, everyday language.
- The assistant should guide users step by step on what actions to take next.
- The system should recommend learning programs, jobs, and skill development opportunities.
- It should share community announcements such as local events, awareness drives, and social initiatives.
- Users should be able to interact using text or voice.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- The interface should be simple and easy to use.
- The system should work well on low-bandwidth and low-end devices.
- The architecture should be scalable for future expansion.
- User data and civic information should be handled securely.
- The system should support multiple languages.

## Constraints
- Initially, the system will rely on publicly available civic data.
- The AI component will use an API-based model in the beginning.
- Internet connectivity is required for real-time information updates.

## Success Criteria
- Users are able to find relevant services and schemes without confusion.
- Community participation increases through better access to announcements.
- Information and language barriers are reduced for users.
